### File Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # App shell and UI structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js          # All application logic and data

## üîß Configuration

### Adding a New Dex
To add support for a new Pok√©dex, edit the `DEXES` object in `app.js`:

```javascript
const DEXES = {
  // Existing dexes...
  
  newdex: {
    title: 'My Custom Dex',
    order: [1, 4, 7, 25, 133], // Array of National Dex IDs
    slotCount: 5,
    storagePrefix: 'newdex'
  }
};
```

Users can then access it via `?dex=newdex` in the URL.

### Customizing Themes
Theme colors are defined as CSS custom properties in `styles.css`. Modify the `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors to customize the appearance.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This project follows these principles:

- **Keep it simple**: No build tools, frameworks, or complex dependencies
- **Vanilla web technologies**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only
- **Accessibility first**: Ensure all features work with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Mobile-friendly**: Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to the source files
2. Test by opening `index.html` in a browser
3. Use browser DevTools for debugging
4. Submit a pull request with your improvements

## üìä Features in Detail

### Multi-Dex System
The app supports multiple Pok√©dex configurations through the `DEXES` object. Each dex defines:
- **Title**: Display name shown in the header
- **Order**: Array of National Dex numbers defining which Pok√©mon and their sequence
- **Slot Count**: Total number of slots in this dex
- **Storage Prefix**: Namespace for localStorage to prevent conflicts

### Intelligent Caching
Species names are cached with:
- **180-day TTL** to handle API changes
- **Hash-based invalidation** when the species list changes
- **Per-dex namespacing** to avoid conflicts between different dexes

### Share System
Progress sharing uses a compact binary encoding:
- Data is compressed into a URL-safe base64 string
- Links are automatically copied to clipboard when generated
- Shared links work across devices and browsers
